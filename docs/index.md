# BBC micro:bit Bird Activity

Hi! 👋

Welcome to the micro:bit Bird Activity page.

## Website Navigation 🧭

We tried to make the contents of this website easy to find, but if something is
missing or hard to find look around for one of the micro:bit helpers and
we'll be happy to help with anything :)

In short:

- ⬅️ The navigation menu on the left has a link to each available page
- ➡️ Each page has a table of contents on the right to jump to each section


## What you'll need ☑️

To go through this activity you'll need:

- 1 laptop
- 1 micro:bit
- 1 USB cable
- 1 battery holder (optional)
- 1 bird of your making (optional, but really fun!)


## micro:bit Python Editor 🐍

For this activity we are going to use the brand new micro:bit Python Editor.

On top of that, we are going to load it with a special flag to enable even
more new features, which you will be one of the first people to check out!

[https://python.microbit.org/v/beta?flag=audioSoundEffect](https://python.microbit.org/v/beta?flag=audioSoundEffect)

You can find more information about the editor in the
[Python Editor page](editor).


## Birds! 🦜 🐥 🦉

And we are going to make some birds using some craft supplies.

Don't worry, if this is not your thing you can still try all this would the
bird, but it is a lot more fun with one!

To see some bird making examples see the 
[Bird Pipe Cleaners page](birdcraft).

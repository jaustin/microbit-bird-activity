# micro:bit Bird Activity

Hi! 👋

Welcome to the micro:bit Bird Activity page.

## Website Navigation

It should be easy to find the contents of this website, but if you can't find
something, look around for one of the micro:bit helpers and we'll be happy to
help with anything :)

In short:

- ⬅️ The navigation menu on the left has a link to each page
- ➡️ Each page has a table of contents on the right to jump to each section


## What you'll need

To go through this activity you'll need:

- 1 laptop
- 1 micro:bit
- 1 USB cable
- 1 battery holder (optional)
- 1 bird of your making (optional, but really fun!)
